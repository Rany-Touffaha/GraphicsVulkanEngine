# GraphicsVulkanEngine

GraphicsVulkanEngine is a custom Vulkan-based rendering engine written in C++. It provides a foundational framework for real-time 3D rendering, featuring low-level GPU resource management, shader integration, and complete graphics pipeline control. 

The engine supports vertex and index buffers, uniform buffers, push-constants, textures, depth-buffering, framebuffer management, and per-frame command recording with synchronization and swap-chain presentation. It is designed to demonstrate the principles of high-performance rendering using Vulkan.
